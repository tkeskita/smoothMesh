# smoothMesh

<img src="images/smooth_mesh.png"/>

OpenFOAM mesh smoothing tool to improve mesh quality. Moves internal
mesh points (and now also optionally boundary mesh points)
by using primarily the Centroidal smoothing algorithm (a
version of the [Laplacian smoothing
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_smoothing), which
uses surrounding cell centers instead of the neighbour point locations
to calculate the new point position). Midpoint of two closest points
is applied instead of centroidal point for prismatic high aspect ratio points.
Optional heuristic quality constraint options exist to constrain the
smoothing, to avoid self-intersections. No changes to mesh topology
are made.

Image below illustrates the need for restricting centroidal
smoothing. Without quality constraints, centroidal smoothing would
move the point highlighted in blue to the location highlighted with
green, which is outside of the domain. Thereby, unconstrained centroidal smoothing
can create self-intersecting cells, depending on the geometry and
topology of the mesh. Self-intersections can be avoided by using
additional quality constraints, which restrict the movement of
vertices.

## Current features and restrictions

- Works on 3D polyhedron meshes (2D meshes are not supported)
- Tested on both OpenFOAM.org v12 and OpenFOAM.com v2412 (likely works
  also on older and newer versions)
- Can be run in parallel or in serial
- Requires a consistent (not self-intersecting or tangled) initial
  mesh with "good enough" quality
- Smoothes internal and (optionally) boundary mesh points
- Optionally controls the thickness and orthogonality of prismatic
  boundary layers to preserve / create boundary layers using existing
  mesh cells

## Compilation instructions

You need to first source OpenFOAM in a terminal, then compile with
```
./Allwclean; ./Allwmake
```

You can optionally run the test cases (they will be copied to folder
`run_tests`) after compilation with
```
./run_tests.sh
```

## Command line options

### Basic options

- `-centroidalIters` specifies the maximum number of smoothing iterations (default 1000).

- `-relTol` is the relative tolerance convergence criteria for stopping smoothing iterations (default 0.02). If residual (maximum length of point moved relative to `maxStepLength`) drops below this value, then smoothing is stopped.

- `-minEdgeLength` defines edge length below which edge points are fully frozen at their current location. Freezing happens only if edge length would decrease during smoothing. Edge length is allowed to increase regardless of this value. If no value is provided, a default value of half the length of the shortest edge in the initial mesh is applied.

- `-maxStepLength` is the maximum allowed length (in metres) for moving a point in one iteration. Smoothing process seems to be stable when this value is in the range 10% - 50% of the minimum cell side length. If no value is specified, a default value of 0.3 times the `minEdgeLength` is applied.

- `-relStepFrac` is a relative step scaling factor, which scales the local step length proposed by smoothing algorithms. It is applied to increase stability of the smoothing process (default value 0.5).

- `-totalMinFreeze` option causes mesh points on all edges shorter than `-minEdgeLength` to freeze, even if edge length would increase in smoothing (default false). This option is useful to keep boundary layers in the mesh unmodified, and smooth the large cells only, if the special boundary layer related options below are not used.

- `-writeInterval` option writes mesh at the interval of given number of iterations, e.g. value 10 causes write every tenth iteration (default value 0).


### Quality constraint options

The following options are related to additional **heuristic quality control constraints for smoothing**. The constraints work by disallowing movement of point (freezing of points) if the movement would cause quality of the mesh to suffer too much. Without constraining, centroidal smoothing may squish cells and create self-intersecting cells e.g. near concave geometry features, depending on the mesh details. Have a look at [the algorithm description document](algorithm_description.md) for details.

- `-edgeAngleConstraint` boolean option enables an additional quality control which restricts decrease of smallest edge-edge angle below `minAngle` (default is true).

- `-faceAngleConstraint` boolean option enables an additional quality control which restricts decrease of smallest and largest face-face angle below `minAngle` and above `maxAngle` (default is true).

- `-minAngle` option defines the value for minimum angle (in degrees, default value 35).

- `-maxAngle` option specifies the value for maximum angle (in degrees, default value 160).

- Note: `-minAngle` value causes point freezing *only* if the minimum angle is below this value and if the minimum angle would *decrease* in smoothing. Points are allowed to move if the minimum angle value *increases* with smoothing, regardless of this value. The same applies for the `-maxAngle` option: Freezing takes place only if maximum angle is above the specified value and if the maximum angle would *increase* in smoothing.

### Boundary layer treatment related options

The options below are related to handling of prismatic cells near mesh boundaries, to either preserve or improve the orthogonality and control the thickness of boundary layer cells in the mesh. If the mesh contains prismatic boundary layers, the unconstrained centroidal smoothing will tend to bloat the boundary layer cells into normal size. That can be avoided using the options below. These options affect only the prismatic cell edges near the mesh boundaries (see [the algorithm description document](algorithm_description.md) for details).

Warning: This is an experimental feature!

- `-layerPatches` option is used to limit the boundary layer treatment to cells next to specified patches only. You can specify one or several patches, optionally with wild cards. For example `-layerPatches 'walls'` or `-layerPatches '( stator "rotor.*" )'`. No patches are included by default.

- `-layerMaxBlendingFraction` is the maximum fraction (0 <= value <= 1) by which boundary layer edge length and edge direction are blended with the centroidal smoothing locations. Zero value disables the effect of all other boundary related variables below (default value 0.5). Values between 0.3 and 0.8 seems to produce good results in practice.

- `-layerEdgeLength` specifies the target thickness for the first boundary layer cells (prismatic side edge length). If no value is provided, the value of `minEdgeLength` is applied.

- `-layerExpansionRatio` specifies the thickness ratio by which the boundary edge length is assumed to increase (default value 1.3).

- `-minLayers` is an integer value specifying the number of boundary layers which experience a full force of boundary blending specified with the `-layerMaxBlendingFraction` option (default value 1).

- `-maxLayers` specifies the number of boundary cell layers beyond which boundary blending options above ceases to affect smoothing, and only centroidal smoothing is applied (default value 4).

## Boundary point smoothing options

Warning: This is a new and experimental feature!

SmoothMesh now has a possibility to move and smooth also boundary points. The usage of this feature requires that the user provides following files in the `constant/geometry` folder in the case directory in Wavefront OBJ format:

- `constant/geometry/initEdges.obj` (**required**). This edge mesh must contain the initial feature edges (sharp edges) of the whole initial mesh. This edge mesh is used to identify which points in the initial mesh are feature edge points. Identification of points is currently based on point locations. Feature edge mesh can be generated e.g. by `Feature Edges` Filter in Paraview, or by `surfaceFeatures` or `surfaceFeatureExtract` commands in OpenFOAM.

- `constant/geometry/targetEdges.obj` (**optional**). This edge mesh file contains the edge mesh locations for the final target mesh. If `targetEdges.obj` is provided, the points on the initial feature edges are projected to these edges during smoothing. If `targetEdges.obj` is not provided, then target edge mesh is assumed to be identical to the initial feature edge mesh. In practice, the result of providing no `targetEdges.obj` is that feature edges stay in their initial locations, but edge points may still move along the feature edges. However, providing `targetEdges.obj `allows projection of e.g. linear block mesh edges to curves.

- `constant/geometry/targetSurfaces.obj` (**required**). This surface mesh file must contain the target surface mesh for all boundary surfaces. The boundary points (besides feature edge points) are projected to closest triangulated surface mesh face provided in this file. The surface mesh can be generated e.g. by `Extract Surface Filter` in Paraview, or `surfaceMeshTriangulate` command in OpenFOAM.

Options for smoothMesh related to boundary point smoothing:

- `-smoothingPatches` option is used to limit the boundary point movement to specified patches only. You can specify one or several patches, optionally with wild cards. For example `-smoothingPatches 'walls'` or `-smoothingPatches '( stator "rotor.*" )'`. All patches are included in smoothing by default.

- `-internalSmoothingBlendingFraction` is related to how the location of the surface points on free boundaries (but not feature edges nor corners!) are calculated. Two methods are applied: Projection of coordinates from centroidal smoothing to closest boundary surface, and projection of inner mesh prismatic point to closest boundary surface. This fraction value specifies the blending (value between 0 and 1) for the inner mesh prismatic point. Value close to 0 means that centroidal smoothing dominates, which results in good boundary surface smoothing. Value close to 1 means that inner mesh point projection dominates, which results in highly orthogonal prismatic boundary edges. The default value of 0.05 favors centroidal smoothing, but also improves orthogonality as smoothing progresses. Note: More work is needed to study the effect of this value on the results.

**Note:** Always view the initial mesh and all OBJ files visually in Paraview for correctness before use!

Example from testcase4 is illustrated below.

## Description of the algorithm

Please view [the algorithm description document](algorithm_description.md).


## Basic usage examples

You can run smoothMesh without providing any parameter values, but the result may not be very good, depending on your initial mesh. It is suggested to adjust at least the `-centroidalIters`, `-relTol`, `-maxStepLength` and `-minEdgeLength` options according to your case.

- Parallel run example: `mpirun -np 3 smoothMesh -centroidalIters 100 -maxStepLength 0.01 -minEdgeLength 0.05 -parallel`

- Serial run example: `smoothMesh -centroidalIters 100 -maxStepLength 0.01 -minEdgeLength 0.05`


## Test cases

The folders named like `testcaseX` contain test cases. E.g. the first `testcase` contains
skewed and non-orthogonal cells, as well as variance in geometric
cell shapes and topology. This is meant to be a challenging (but not
impossible) task for centroidal smoothing.

Note: SmoothMesh has been developed further since this test was done
(5/2025), the test results below have not yet been updated!
